# Heavy Equipment Auction Price Prediction
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the auction sale price of heavy equipment, specifically bulldozers, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a "blue book" for bulldozers, providing an accurate estimate of their market value based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from source, e.g., Kaggle's Blue Book for Bulldozers. It includes information such as:

Equipment type

Auctioneer ID

Machine hours

Usage and configuration

Year made

Sale date

Equipment specifics like model and make

## Features
The features used in this project include:


Date features: Year, month, and day of the auction.

Categorical features: Equipment type, model, and make.

Numerical features: Machine hours, age of equipment, etc.

Derived features: Features engineered from the existing dataset to enhance model performance.
